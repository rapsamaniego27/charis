                How are you doing? Hope you are enjoying the heat right now as it is really hot. Haha! Anyway, I hope
                you understand why I had to go away, it's for you to have more space to breathe and not to think about
                me. This way, you'll get to think about your boyfriend more. Sorry but I really just respect people's
                relationships. I do feel sad yes. As much as things are going wrong in your way, I'm partly responsible
                also and I did my best to help you out just for you to decide on things in a straight line.

            The results doesn't matter to me, what matters to me is that you learn to fight for yourself, to never be
            scared to open up. Nakakahiya naman sa Instagram username mo courageouscha, pero takutin ka hahaha! Wag
            ganun. Always have a positive mindset. Were gonna make a lot of mistakes, but learning nothing from the
            mistake is the MISTAKE.
            <br><br>
            I also wanted to thank you that I got to know someone like you, and you've given me a chance to feel love
            again. Even though it's online. I genuinely did feel the support and sweetness you gave and always wanted to
            give it back. I was really excited to see you pa naman, play games with you, cook for you, to jam with you
            and even introduce you to Lala, but it looks like its not gonna happen anymore.
            <br><br>
            I just pretend that I don't care, but I really do. In fact, I even get to miss you.
            But there's always the right time to give hugs, the right time to kiss and the right time to love.
            This is just a bad time for us both, and I don't want to be anymore part of the chaos that's been happening.
            I really wish you the best sa boyfriend mo, stay safe to you both.
            <br><br>
            I'm gonna stop communicating with you, but if you ever do need someone to talk to in the future. Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, 
            all you've got to do is call
            <br><br>
            But for now it's goodbye and farewell.
